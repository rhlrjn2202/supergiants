					<description><![CDATA[Cup gold medal with a blistering 129-92 win over Serbia (5-4) at the Palacio de os Deportes de la Comunidad arena]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cup gold medal with a blistering 129-92 win over Serbia (5-4) at the Palacio de os Deportes de la Comunidad arena on Sunday night in Madrid, Spain. The USA, which distanced itself from Serbia early in the game with a 28-6 run to close the first quarter, became just the third country in FIBA World Cup history to capture consecutive titles, and more crucial, the championship earned the USA an automatic bid into the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs; this &#8220;platoon&#8221; system replaced the original system, which featured limited substitution rules, and has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special teams squads. AUBURN — Kevin Steele isn’t happy with the decision LSU officials made Sunday to terminate head football coach Les Miles. When asked Sunday evening about reports confirming Miles was fired just four games into his 13th season as LSU’s head coach, the first-year Auburn defensive coordinator gave an emotional and logic-based response to the news.</p>
